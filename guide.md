## What is &ldquo;vicloc&rdquo;?

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

&ldquo;Vicloc&rdquo; (a\.k\.a. &ldquo;viclock&rdquo;) stands for
&ldquo;Victoria-Island-locked&rdquo;. Characters playing in this style of
MapleStory (who may be called &ldquo;viclockers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Victoria
Islanders&rdquo;) leave Maple Island<sup>\[1\]</sup>, but upon doing so, never
leave Victoria Island (a\.k\.a. &ldquo;Vic Island&rdquo; or simply
&ldquo;Vic&rdquo;). We define Victoria Island as the [union] of the following
regions of the Maple World:

- The main continent:
    - Lith Harbour
    - Perion
    - Ellinia
    - Henesys
    - Kerning City
    - Nautilus Harbour
    - Sleepywood
- Amoria
- Florina Beach
- The Free Market

Like Maple Islanders (a\.k\.a. &ldquo;islanders&rdquo;), Victoria Islanders are
largely isolated from &ldquo;outlanders&rdquo; (non-vicloc characters), albeit
to a lesser degree. They cannot trade with, nor receive items/mesos from,
outlanders. They also cannot use [gachapon
machines](https://maplelegends.com/lib/npc?id=9100100), nor certain Cash Shop
items like e\.g. [Myo Myo](https://maplelegends.com/lib/cash?id=5450000). For a
full list of the rules of vicloc, please see [rules\.md](./rules.md).

Because they can never leave Vic Island, viclockers can never advance beyond
second job. This reflects an earlier version of MapleStory, wherein the
Training Camp, Maple Island, and Victoria Island collectively made up the known
Maple World. However, vicloc can be played even in advanced versions of the
game, which may have other continents (e\.g. Ossyria), pirates, fourth job,
etc. For this reason, we consider new canonical additions to Victoria Island —
e\.g. Nautilus Harbour and Amoria — to be part of Victoria Island for the
purpose of vicloc.

\[1\]: For technical reasons, we consider campers (who never leave the Training
Camp) and Maple Islanders (who never leave Maple Island) to be [special
cases][degeneracy] of vicloc characters; however, this is _not usually_ what we
mean by &ldquo;vicloc&rdquo;.

### Why vicloc?

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

Ultimately, the simple answer to this question is: because it&rsquo;s fun. But
it&rsquo;s worth exploring a little bit about what makes vicloc so special.

When compared to usual MapleStory play in most servers, vicloc settling for
less &mdash; viz. no third job, no fourth job, and generally lower-level
characters &mdash; is actually a huge asset. In gameplay styles with these
higher-powered characters, the higher jobs and higher levels are wildly
different from the earlier parts of the game, and the rest of the game gets
warped around them. Thus, the average player&rsquo;s goal is merely to get to
&ldquo;the endgame&rdquo; as quickly as possible, ultimately forgetting what
makes MapleStory so good to begin with! Along with this comes undesirable modes
of gameplay (or lack of gameplay) like washing, leeching, etc., as well as
serious balance issues due to the inflated power of almost all truly useful
skills in the game.

With vicloc, there is only MapleStory. Victoria Island is a lot bigger than you
think, if you care to explore it. And you&rsquo;ll find that vicloc suffers
from fewer issues of game balance, giving you more time to explore the world
and do fun stuff with your friends, without having to worry about that stuff.

When compared to Maple Islanding (&ldquo;islanding&rdquo; in the usual sense),
vicloc is obviously less restrictive, has more content to explore, and more
jobs &amp; character builds to try out. Vicloc is a [strict
superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of Maple Islanding, adding just
enough to the game to make it richer, without running into the issues discussed
above. Depending on the server/implementation that you&rsquo;re playing on,
viclockers may have access to off-Maple-Island content such as&hellip;:

- Classes such as:
    - Warriors (sword(wo)men, fighters, pages, spear(wo)men).
    - Mages (magicians, fire/poison magicians, ice/lightning magicians,
      clerics).
    - Archers (archers, hunters, crossbow(o)men).
    - Thieves (rogues, assassins, bandits).
    - Pirates (pirates, brawlers, gunslingers).

- [Sharenian Party Quest](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=990000000) (SPQ;
  a\.k\.a. Guild Party Quest, GPQ).

## General guidelines for viclocking

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

- Victoria Island is your domain. It&rsquo;s your duty to explore it in all of
  its niches and obscurities: do the quests that you can find, kill the
  monsters that you can find, and carve your own path.
- There is always difficulty at the beginning. Vicloc is pretty brutal when
  first starting out, and you&rsquo;ll be aching for potion money. However,
  with some shrewdness and determination, anyone can surpass this level of
  financial despair!
- Defences (WDEF and MDEF) actually matter in vicloc. Yes, you heard that
  right.
- &hellip;
- Have fun!!
