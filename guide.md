## What is &ldquo;vicloc&rdquo;?

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

![An example world map of Victoria
Island](./img/victoria-island-world-map.webp
"An example world map of Victoria Island")

&ldquo;Vicloc&rdquo; (a\.k\.a. &ldquo;viclock&rdquo;) stands for
&ldquo;Victoria-Island-locked&rdquo;. Characters playing in this style of
MapleStory (who may be called &ldquo;viclockers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Victoria
Islanders&rdquo;) leave Maple Island<sup>\[1\]</sup>, but upon doing so, never
leave Victoria Island (a\.k\.a. &ldquo;Vic Island&rdquo; or simply
&ldquo;Vic&rdquo;). We define Victoria Island as the [union] of the following
regions of the Maple World:

- The main continent:
    - [Lith Harbor](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=104000000)
    - [Perion](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=102000000)
    - [Ellinia](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=101000000)
    - [Henesys](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=100000000)
    - [Kerning City](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=103000000)
    - [Nautilus Harbor](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=120000000)
    - [Sleepywood](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=105040300)
- [Amoria](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=680000000)
- [Florina Beach](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=110000000)
- [The Free Market](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=910000000)

Like Maple Islanders (a\.k\.a. &ldquo;islanders&rdquo;), Victoria Islanders are
largely isolated from &ldquo;outlanders&rdquo; (non-vicloc characters), albeit
to a lesser degree. They cannot trade with, nor receive items/mesos from,
outlanders. They also cannot use [gachapon
machines](https://maplelegends.com/lib/npc?id=9100100), nor certain Cash Shop
items like e\.g. [Myo Myo](https://maplelegends.com/lib/cash?id=5450000). For a
full list of the rules of vicloc, please see [rules\.md](./rules.md).

Because they can never leave Vic Island, viclockers can never advance beyond
second job. This reflects an earlier version of MapleStory, wherein the
Training Camp, Maple Island, and Victoria Island collectively made up the known
Maple World. However, vicloc can be played even in advanced versions of the
game, which may have other continents (e\.g. Ossyria), pirates, fourth job,
etc. For this reason, we consider new canonical additions to Victoria Island ‚Äî
e\.g. Nautilus Harbor and Amoria ‚Äî to be part of Victoria Island for the
purpose of vicloc.

\[1\]: For technical reasons, we consider campers (who never leave the Training
Camp) and Maple Islanders (who never leave Maple Island) to be [special
cases][degeneracy] of vicloc characters; however, this is _not usually_ what we
mean by &ldquo;vicloc&rdquo;.

### Why vicloc?

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

![The boy Icarus](./img/icarus.webp "The boy Icarus")

Ultimately, the simple answer to this question is: because it&rsquo;s fun. But
it&rsquo;s worth exploring a little bit about what makes vicloc so special.

When compared to usual MapleStory play in most servers, vicloc settling for
less &mdash; viz. no third job, no fourth job, and generally lower-level
characters &mdash; is actually a huge asset. In gameplay styles with these
higher-powered characters, the higher jobs and higher levels are wildly
different from the earlier parts of the game, and the rest of the game gets
warped around them. Thus, the average player&rsquo;s goal is merely to get to
&ldquo;the endgame&rdquo; as quickly as possible, ultimately forgetting what
makes MapleStory so good to begin with! Along with this comes undesirable modes
of gameplay (or lack of gameplay) like washing, leeching, etc., as well as
serious [balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance) issues due to the
inflated power of almost all truly useful skills in the game.

With vicloc, there is only MapleStory. Victoria Island is a lot bigger than you
think, if you care to explore it. And you&rsquo;ll find that vicloc suffers
from fewer issues of game balance, giving you more time to explore the world
and do fun stuff with your friends, without having to worry about that stuff.

When compared to Maple Islanding (&ldquo;islanding&rdquo; in the usual sense),
vicloc is obviously less restrictive, has more content to explore, and more
jobs &amp; character builds to try out. Vicloc is a [strict
superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of Maple Islanding, adding just
enough to the game to make it richer, without running into the issues discussed
above. Depending on the server/implementation that you&rsquo;re playing on,
viclockers may have access to off-Maple-Island content such as&hellip;:

- Classes such as:
    - Warriors (sword(wo)men, fighters, pages, spear(wo)men).
    - Mages (magicians, fire/poison magicians, ice/lightning magicians,
      clerics).
    - Archers (archers, hunters, crossbow(o)men).
    - Thieves (rogues, assassins, bandits).
    - Pirates (pirates, brawlers, gunslingers).
- [Henesys Party Quest](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=910010000) (HPQ).
- [Kerning Party Quest](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=103000800) (KPQ).
- [Amoria Party Quest](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=670010100) (APQ).
- [Sharenian Party Quest](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=990000000) (SPQ;
  a\.k\.a. Guild Party Quest, GPQ).
- Many quests &amp; questlines!
- Area bosses such as:
    - [Mano](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=2220000).
    - [Stumpy](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=3220000).
    - [Faust](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=5220002).
    - [Mushmom](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=6130101).
    - [King Clang](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=5220000).
    - [Zombie Mushmom](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=6300005).
    - [Dyle](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=6220000).
    - [Jr. Balrog](https://maplelegends.com/lib/monster?id=8130100).
- Countless equipment items to use &amp; to upgrade.
- Jump quests.
- The whole island of Victoria to explore, with all of its flora &amp; fauna!

## General guidelines for viclocking

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

![Guidebook](./img/beginner-s-guide.webp "Guidebook")

- Victoria Island is your domain. It&rsquo;s your duty to explore it in all of
  its niches and obscurities: do the quests that you can find, kill the
  monsters that you can find, and carve your own path.
- There is always difficulty at the beginning. Vicloc is pretty brutal when
  first starting out, and you&rsquo;ll be aching for potion money. However,
  with some shrewdness and determination, anyone can overcome this financial
  despair!
- Defences (WDEF and MDEF) actually matter in vicloc. Yes, you heard that
  right.
- Events are your best friend. Events allow viclockers access to activities,
  locations, and items that they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have access to.
- \[&hellip;TODO&hellip;\]
- Have fun!!

## A comparison of vicloc classes/jobs

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

![Job instructors](./img/job-instructors.webp "Job instructors")

As mentioned above, [game balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance)
pans out differently in vicloc than it does in other modes of gameplay, despite
there being essentially the same character archetypes. This is, in part, due to
the lack of third and fourth jobs in vicloc &mdash; second job is the highest
job advancement for viclockers. That being said, these differences in game
balance generally turn out for the better: for the most part, every class in
vicloc has its place, and no class is gratuitously &ldquo;more powerful&rdquo;
than any other.

With this in mind, let&rsquo;s take a look at each class individually, and
consider how it compares to the others.

### üî∞ Beginners

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

As you&rsquo;d expect,
[permabeginners](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#permabeginner-outland)
play similarly to how they do outside of vicloc; naturally, they don&rsquo;t
care that third and fourth job don&rsquo;t exist. On the other hand, this
isn&rsquo;t _quite_ true: the overall lower-powered nature of vicloc characters
in general allows a dedicated permabeginner who hones their craft to remain
more relevant than they would in other modes of gameplay.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Warriors

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

From a bird&rsquo;s-eye view, most warriors (with the exception of some odd
ones) tend to play very similarly: their bread-and-butter is the use of [Power
Strike](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001004) and [Slash
Blast](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1001005) in conjunction with melee
weapons. In addition, warriors make for very strong support, as well: each of
the three warrior second-job classes has its own party support skill (or two
such skills, in the case of spear(wo)man). And, last but not least, warriors
are also characterised by their natural durability.

Their ability to easily survive and support the party, combined with their
ability to effectively deal multi-target and single-target DPS from first job
onwards, makes warriors extremely powerful at all levels of the game.

#### Fighter

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** &ldquo;rage pls&rdquo;

Fighters differentiate themselves from other warriors mainly in two ways:
weapon choice (swords and/or axes), and
[Rage](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101006). It&rsquo;s difficult to
understate just how important Rage is in vicloc; without it, physical attackers
are generally stuck with either [Warrior
Potion](https://maplelegends.com/lib/use?id=2002004)s (+5 WATK), or the much
more difficult-to-farm [Drake&rsquo;s
Blood](https://maplelegends.com/lib/use?id=2012000) (+8 WATK). This means that
virtually any party that wishes to optimise their DPS output must have at least
one fighter amongst their ranks.

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Rage is by far the most powerful sustainable damage buff in the game.
- Good multi-target and single-target DPS from first job onwards, and
  comfortability and melee combat.
    - Their solid multi-target DPS and comfortability in melee combat makes
      them extremely good at farming crowded maps like
      [FoG](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=105040306).
- Naturally very durable. Fighters are also the most resistant to physical
  attacks of any class in the game (tied with page), due to [Power
  Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1101007).
    - Also due to Power Guard, fighters make excellent [HP
      warriors](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#hp-warrior).

Cons:

- Naturally short reach means that they have to constantly stay adjacent to
  their foe(s).
- Poor mobility.
- Not quite as high potential for single-target or multi-target DPS, when
  compared to certain other classes.
- Accuracy issues (with the exception of some odd ones, e\.g. [DEX
  fighters](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#dex-warrior)).

</details>

#### Page

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** All foes cower before the page&rsquo;s threatening
presence.

Pages differentiate themselves from other warriors mainly in two ways: weapon
choice (blunt weapons and/or swords), and
[Threaten](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1201006). Like the Rage of
fighters, Threaten can be used to optimise the party&rsquo;s DPS output.
However, unlike Rage, Threaten is a debuff that lowers the foe&rsquo;s
resistance to physical attacks, _and_ their ability to deal physical damage.
This is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, this means that Threaten is only
truly useful during boss fights, and usually not so much when training/hunting;
on the other hand, this means that Threaten is especially powerful against
strong bosses like those found in
[SPQ](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=990000000),
[APQ](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=670010100), and [The Cursed
Sanctuary](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=105090900), and has defensive
effects (i\.e. it&rsquo;s not purely offensive).

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Threaten is a powerful party support skill with both offensive and defensive
  effects, very useful during boss fights.
- Good multi-target and single-target DPS from first job onwards, and
  comfortability and melee combat.
    - Their solid multi-target DPS and comfortability in melee combat makes
      them extremely good at farming crowded maps like
      [FoG](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=105040306).
- Naturally very durable. Pages are also the most resistant to physical attacks
  of any class in the game (tied with fighter), due to [Power
  Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1201007).
    - Also due to Power Guard, pages make good [HP
      warriors](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#hp-warrior).

Cons:

- Naturally short reach means that they have to constantly stay adjacent to
  their foe(s).
- Poor mobility.
- Not quite as high potential for single-target or multi-target DPS, when
  compared to certain other classes.
- Accuracy issues (with the exception of some odd ones, e\.g. [DEX
  pages](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#dex-warrior)).
- Threaten is not always useful; its usefulness is _usually_ limited to boss
  fights.

</details>

#### Spear(wo)man

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** Protect your party!

Spear(wo)men differentiate themselves from other warriors mainly in two ways:
weapon choice (polearms and/or spears), and [Hyper
Body](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1301007)/[Iron
Will](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1301006). Unlike fighters and
pages, the spear(wo)man has not one, but two party support skills, and both are
purely defensive. The extreme power of these two skills combined makes the
spear(wo)man the ultimate party protector, and can also help the party to save
money on potions.

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Hyper Body &amp; Iron Will form the most powerful party-defence arsenal in
  the game.
- Good multi-target and single-target DPS from first job onwards, and
  comfortability and melee combat.
    - Their solid multi-target DPS and comfortability in melee combat makes
      them extremely good at farming crowded maps like
      [FoG](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=105040306).
- Naturally extremely durable.

Cons:

- Naturally short reach means that they have to constantly stay adjacent to
  their foe(s), although the have a mild advantage over one-handed weapon users
  due to the large reach of polearms &amp; spears.
- Poor mobility.
- Not quite as high potential for single-target or multi-target DPS, when
  compared to certain other classes.
- Accuracy issues (with the exception of some odd ones, e\.g. [DEX
  spear(wo)men](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#dex-warrior)).
- Hyper Body &amp; Iron Will are susceptible to being dispelled in
  [SPQ](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=990000000) and
  [APQ](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=670010100). Furthermore, these
  skills are largely just meso-saving skills, outside of the realm of boss
  fights.

</details>

### üßô Mages

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

Mages are entirely unique in their ability to deal magical damage, and in their
ability to deal elemental damage. They are also naturally mobile due to
[Teleport](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101002), and naturally fairly
durable with [Magic Guard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2001002).
However, beyond this, the three mage classes diverge considerably.

#### Fire/poison magician

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** Huge single-target elemental DPS.

Fire/poison magicians sit alongside thieves as the only classes that lack
multi-target attacks entirely. This results in F/P magicians being the
[red-headed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/red-headed_stepchild)<sup>\[1\]</sup>
[stepchild](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/red-headed_stepchild) when it comes
to mages. However, F/P magicians can make up for this with their high
single-target DPS (higher than any mage), unique ability to poison monsters,
unique choice of elements, and mild party utility in the form of
[Meditation](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101001).

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Highest single-target magical DPS in the game.
    - This can come in extra handy with bosses/monsters that can cancel weapon
      attacks, e\.g. in [SPQ](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=990000000)
      and [APQ](https://maplelegends.com/lib/map?id=670010100).
- Unique ability to poison monsters with [Poison
  Breath](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101005), which deals damage
  over time proportional to the monster&rsquo;s MAXHP.
- Unique ability to deal fire-typed and poison-typed damage, which makes them
  extra effective against monsters that are weak to either of these elements.
- Extremely mobile due to Teleport.
- Fairly sturdy due to Magic Guard and [Magic
  Armor](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2001003).
- Modestly large reach, while retaining the ability to attack normally at melee
  range.
- Meditation is by far the most powerful sustainable MATK buff in the game.
- No accuracy issues.

Cons:

- Although their single-target DPS is very impressive, some physical attackers
  may be able to outdo them against monsters that are vulnerable to physical
  attacks.
- Although the poison effect deals damage based on the MAXHP of the monster,
  most monsters with very high MAXHP are bosses, which are unaffected by the
  poisoning effect.
- Crippled in the presence of monsters that are resistant and/or immune to fire
  and/or poison.
- Extremely fragile when dispelled, due to losing Magic Guard.
- Not as large reach as truly &ldquo;ranged&rdquo; classes.
- Meditation is only useful as a party buff when one or more clerics and/or
  magicians are in the party.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Footnotes for &ldquo;Fire/poison magician&rdquo;</summary>

\[1\]: Pun intended.

</details>

#### Ice/lightning magician

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** Farm with ease.

Ice/lightning magicians are notable for their ability to use
[Thunderbolt](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2201005), perhaps the most
versatile and powerful multi-target attack in the game. They also possess the
ability to freeze individual monsters with [Cold
Beam](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2201004), a unique choice of
elements, and mild party utility in the form of
[Meditation](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2201001). This results in
I/L magicians having a reputation for being the premier
farming/grinding/hunting class in vicloc.

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Thunderbolt is perhaps the most versatile and powerful multi-target attack in
  the game.
- Ability to freeze monsters with Cold Beam.
- Unique ability to deal ice-typed and lightning-typed damage, which makes them
  extra effective against monsters that are weak to either of these elements.
- Extremely mobile due to Teleport.
- Fairly sturdy due to Magic Guard and [Magic
  Armor](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2001003).
- Modestly large reach, while retaining the ability to attack normally at melee
  range.
- Meditation is by far the most powerful sustainable MATK buff in the game.
- No accuracy issues.

Cons:

- Although their multi-target DPS is extremely impressive, their single-target
  DPS is unremarkable (although still better than e\.g. clerics).
- Crippled in the presence of monsters that are resistant and/or immune to ice
  and/or lightning.
- Extremely fragile when dispelled, due to losing Magic Guard.
- Not as large reach as truly &ldquo;ranged&rdquo; classes.
- Meditation is only useful as a party buff when one or more clerics and/or
  magicians are in the party.

</details>

#### Cleric

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** The ultimate party support &amp; undead-slayer.

Clerics are, naturally, known for their party support abilities. This largely
comes in the form of two skills in particular:
[Heal](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2301002) and
[Bless](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2301004). Although clerics
generally have trouble keeping up with other mages in terms of DPS output,
their very high value to a party, their extra durability, and their still very
high effectiveness at gaining EXP, makes them an irreplaceable member of the
mage family.

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Heal &amp; Bless make them extremely valuable to the party.
- Very strong ability to farm EXP, via the use of Heal.
- Unique ability to deal heal-typed and holy-typed damage, which makes them
  extra effective against monsters that are weak to either of these elements
  (usually, undeads).
- Extremely mobile due to Teleport.
- Very sturdy due to Magic Guard, [Magic
  Armor](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2001003), and their signature
  defensive skill: [Invincible](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2301003).
- Modestly large reach, while retaining the ability to attack normally at melee
  range.
- No accuracy issues.
- Clerics make better [STR
  mages](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#str-mage)
  than other varieties of mage.

Cons:

- Although their ability to farm EXP is remarkable, their ability to deal DPS
  in general (single-target or multi-target) is very poor, made only mildly
  better by the addition of [Holy
  Arrow](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2301005).
- Unable to effectively train on non-undead monsters, and crippled in the
  presence of monsters that are resistant to holy.
- Extremely fragile when dispelled, due to losing Magic Guard and Invincible.
- Not as large reach as truly &ldquo;ranged&rdquo; classes.
- Cannot get [Meditation](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2101001) unless
  there is an F/P or I/L magician in their party.

</details>

### üèπ Archers

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

Archers are ranged physical attackers, which makes them valued for their
single-target DPS. In addition, they are also extremely capable at multi-target
DPS, making them very strong at hunting &amp; at levelling up. They also boast
the largest reach in the game (ever so slightly more than the assassin), as
well as the highest accuracy in the game (with the exception of some odd jobs,
e\.g. [DEX
brawlers](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#dex-brawler)).
To compensate for their extreme combat capabilities, archers are
characteristically squishy, lacking any real defences whatsoever. Furthermore,
they have nothing to offer their party other than damage. This makes archers
very effective at levelling up and doing incredible damage at a large distance,
but ultimately reliant on their party in difficult settings.

#### Hunter

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** Incredible damage, incredible versatility.

Hunters differentiate themselves from crossbow(o)men in two ways: their choice
of weapon (bows), and their use of [Arrow
Bomb](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3101005). Arrow Bomb is more
versatile than its crossbow counterpart ([Iron
Arrow](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3201005)), because its path can
curve to meet its initial target, and because it affects monsters in a radius
around the initially struck monster. It also stuns monsters, giving hunters a
debuff &mdash; something that crossbow(o)men totally lack. However, its damage
output suffers considerably when compared to Iron Arrow, and it relies more on
hitting as close to six monsters at once as possible.

<details>
<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Extremely high single-target DPS from first job onwards, and very high
  multi-target DPS in second job.
- Arrow Bomb is more versatile &amp; easier to use than Iron Arrow.
- Arrow Bomb stuns, unlike Iron Arrow.
- Has [Power Knock-Back](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3101003),
  allowing them to effectively deal with non-boss monsters that approach them
  in melee.
- Largest reach in the game (tied with the crossbow(o)man).
- Highest accuracy in the game (tied with the crossbow(o)man, with the
  exception of some odd jobs, e\.g. [DEX
  brawlers](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#dex-brawler)).

Cons:

- Extremely squishy, having no defences whatsoever.
- Nothing to offer their party other than damage.
- Arrow Bomb deals out considerably less damage than Iron Arrow.
- Arrow Bomb relies more on hitting as close to six monsters at once as
  possible, when compared to Iron Arrow.
- Can&rsquo;t really do much other than Power Knock-Back when too close to
  their foe(s).
- Cannot attack while in mid-air.
- Very slightly lower single-target DPS in comparison to assassins.

#### Crossbow(o)man

[\[&uarr; Go back to top &uarr;\]](#a-guide-to-vicloc)

**Elevator pitch:** Incredible damage, incredible versatility.

Crossbow(o)men differentiate themselves from hunters in two ways: their choice
of weapon (crossbows), and their use of [Iron
Arrow](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3201005). Iron Arrow deals out
considerably more damage than its bow counterpart ([Arrow
Bomb](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3101005)). It also relies less on
hitting as close to six monsters at once as possible. However, it does not stun
monsters, and is less versatile than Arrow Bomb, due to always shooting in a
straight horizontal path.

<summary>Pros &amp; cons</summary>

Pros:

- Extremely high single-target DPS from first job onwards, and very high
  multi-target DPS in second job.
- Iron Arrow deals out considerably more damage than Arrow Bomb.
- Iron Arrow relies less on hitting as close to six monsters at once as
  possible, when compared to Arrow Bomb.
- Has [Power Knock-Back](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3201003),
  allowing them to effectively deal with non-boss monsters that approach them
  in melee.
- Largest reach in the game (tied with the hunter).
- Highest accuracy in the game (tied with the hunter, with the exception of
  some odd jobs, e\.g. [DEX
  brawlers](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/guides/introduction-to-odd-jobs/#dex-brawler)).

Cons:

- Extremely squishy, having no defences whatsoever.
- Nothing to offer their party other than damage.
- Iron Arrow is less versatile &amp; less easy-to-use than Arrow Bomb, due to
  always shooting in a straight horizontal path.
- Iron Arrow does not stun, unlike Arrow Bomb.
- Can&rsquo;t really do much other than Power Knock-Back when too close to
  their foe(s).
- Cannot attack while in mid-air.
- Very slightly lower single-target DPS in comparison to assassins.
