# Vicloc rules

1. You must leave Maple Island, but upon doing so, you must never leave
   Victoria Island. “Victoria Island” is defined as the [union][union] of: the
   main continent (Lith Harbour, Perion, Ellinia, Henesys, Kerning City,
   Nautilus Harbour, Sleepywood), Amoria, & Florina Beach.
    - **Clarification:** Maple Islanders (i.e. “islanders” in the traditional
      sense) are considered to be effectively vicloc for the purpose of all of
      these rules. The reason for this is that we can think of Maple Islanders
      as vicloc characters who simply have not left Maple Island yet.
2. You may not receive any items/mesos from
   [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character)s that are not also
   vicloc, regardless of whether or not you are trading/buying/selling. For
   example, picking up an item that a non-vicloc PC drops is verboten, and so
   is selling an item to a non-vicloc PC. You may, however, give away
   items/mesos to any PCs (vicloc or not). The only exception to this rule is
   for [Soft Feathers](https://maplelegends.com/lib/etc?id=4003005); a maximum
   of 20 Soft Feathers per character may be transferred from a non-vicloc
   character to a vicloc character, for the purpose of marriage.
3. You may not operate [gachapon
   machine](https://maplelegends.com/lib/npc?id=9100100)s. Any gachapon tickets
   that you accrue may be transferred to other characters via the Cash Shop
   inventory (similar to the situation with islanders).
4. You may not make use of [Myo Myo the Traveling
   Salesman](https://maplelegends.com/lib/cash?id=5450000) (an NX/Cash Shop
   item).
5. You may not make use of Cash Shop “Weather” effects that grant
   game-mechanical benefits, e.g. WATK/MATK/WDEF/etc. buffs.
6. You may not receive leech, from anyone (vicloc or not), for any price
   (including zero).
7. You may not HP wash nor MP wash. Obviously you can still “bloodwash” (add AP
   into HP permanently) and/or “bluewash” (add AP into MP permanently), as
   these are not actually washing at all.
8. You may not make use of buff mules
   ([HS](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2311003) mules,
   [SE](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3121002) mules,
   [HB](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1301007) mules, etc.).
