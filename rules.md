# Vicloc rules

1. You must leave Maple Island, but upon doing so, you must never leave
   Victoria Island. “Victoria Island” is defined as the [union][union] of: the
   main continent (Lith Harbour, Perion, Ellinia, Henesys, Kerning City,
   Nautilus Harbour, Sleepywood), Amoria, & Florina Beach.
    - **Clarification:** Maple Islanders (i.e. “islanders” in the traditional
      sense) are considered to be effectively vicloc for the purpose of all of
      these rules. The reason for this is that we can think of Maple Islanders
      as vicloc characters who simply have not left Maple Island yet.
2. You may not receive any items/mesos from
   [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character)s that are not vicloc.
   This includes (viz. all of the items in the following list are disallowed):
    - Selling items to non-vicloc PCs.
    - Buying items from non-vicloc PCs.
    - Trading items and/or mesos with non-vicloc PCs.
    - Looting items/mesos that are dropped by non-vicloc PCs.
    - Looting items/mesos that are dropped by monsters, when those items/mesos
      are not immediately lootable by at least one vicloc PC immediately after
      dropping.\*

   You may, however, give away items/mesos to any PCs (vicloc or not).

    - **Exception:** A maximum of 20 [Soft
      Feathers](https://maplelegends.com/lib/etc?id=4003005) per vicloc
      character may be transferred from a non-vicloc character to a vicloc
      character, for the express purpose of marriage.
    - **Exception:** This rule does not apply to PQ (party quest) items. PQ
      items are items that are automatically destroyed upon entering the PQ
      that they originate from (unless successfully “smuggled” in, of course).
    - \***Clarification:** The asterisked (\*) list item above hinges on the
      fact that if a monster is “whited”ᵃ by a PC, then only that PC — and any
      other PCs in their party — are immediately capable of looting the
      items/mesos dropped by said monster. Other PCs must wait for the
      items’/mesos’ looting restrictions to wear off, and/or must wait to join
      the party of the PC who whited.
    - \***Restriction:** Looting items/mesos dropped by a monster that you did
      not white is usually allowed, provided that the PC who whited was vicloc
      and/or a fellow party member at the time of the monster’s death. However,
      if the PC who whited was non-vicloc, then you may only loot the
      items/mesos if you were an “active” party member at the time of the
      monster’s death. It is left to the reader to decide what exactly “active”
      means in this context.
3. You may not operate [gachapon
   machine](https://maplelegends.com/lib/npc?id=9100100)s. Any gachapon tickets
   that you accrue may be transferred to other characters via the Cash Shop
   inventory (similar to the situation with islanders).
4. You may not make use of [Myo Myo the Traveling
   Salesman](https://maplelegends.com/lib/cash?id=5450000) (an NX/Cash Shop
   item).
5. You may not make use of Cash Shop “Weather” effects that grant
   game-mechanical benefits, e.g. WATK/MATK/WDEF/etc. buffs.
6. You may not receive leech, from anyone (vicloc or not), for any price
   (including zero).
7. You may not HP wash nor MP wash. Obviously you can still “bloodwash” (add AP
   into HP permanently) and/or “bluewash” (add AP into MP permanently), as
   these [are not actually washing at
   all](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/misnomer).
8. You may not make use of buff mules
   ([HS](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=2311003) mules,
   [SE](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=3121002) mules,
   [HB](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=1301007) mules, etc.).
9. You may not possess equipment items that exclusively originate from event
   (e.g. anniversary event, summer event, Christmas event, etc.) sources.
   Vicloc PCs who are in possession of such items may either give them away to
   non-vicloc PCs, or destroy them outright.
    - **Exception:** This rule does not apply to event-only equipment items
      that do not confer game-mechanical benefits. This includes e.g. most NX
      equipment, and even [Maple Bandana
      White](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01002515), as it has the
      same number (7) of slots as any ordinary hat.
    - **Exception:** This rule does not apply to “just for fun” weapons that
      are otherwise useless (or only seriously used by odd-jobbed characters).
      This includes, but is not limited to:
        - [Sweet Fork Cake](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01472088),
        - [Magical Mitten](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01472063),
        - [Torch](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01302084),
        - [Maple Flag](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01302033),
        - [Blue Maple Flag](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01302065),
        - [Pumpkin Basket](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01302034).

---

a: The term “\[to\] white \[a monster\]” is from the sense of getting a
white-coloured EXP notification when the monster dies. Whiting a monster means
dealing a plurality (a.k.a. relative majority) of the damage that the monster
takes over its entire lifetime.
