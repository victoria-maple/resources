# Vicloc rules

1. You must leave Maple Island, but upon doing so, you must never leave
   Victoria Island. “Victoria Island” is defined as the union of: the main
   continent (Lith Harbour, Perion, Ellinia, Henesys, Kerning City, Nautilus
   Harbour, Sleepywood), Amoria, & Florina Beach.
2. You may not receive any items/mesos from
   [PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character)s that are not also
   vicloc, regardless of whether or not you are trading/buying/selling. For
   example, picking up an item that a non-vicloc PC drops is verboten, and so
   is selling an item to a non-vicloc PC. You may, however, give away
   items/mesos to any PCs (vicloc or not). The only exception to this rule is
   for [Soft Feathers](https://maplelegends.com/lib/etc?id=4003005); a maximum
   of 20 Soft Feathers per character may be transfered from a non-vicloc
   character to a vicloc character, for the purpose of marriage.
3. You may not operate gachapon machines. Any gachapon tickets that you accrue
   may be transfered to other characters via the Cash Shop inventory (similar
   to the situation with islanders).
4. You may not make use of Myo Myo the Traveling Salesman (an NX/Cash Shop
   item).
5. You may not make use of Cash Shop “Weather” effects that grant
   game-mechanical benefits, e.g. WATK/MATK/WDEF/etc. buffs.
6. You may not receive leech, from anyone (vicloc or not), for any price
   (including zero).
7. You may not HP wash nor MP wash. Obviously you can still “bloodwash” (add AP
   into HP permanently) and/or “bluewash” (add AP into MP permanently), as
   these are not actually washing at all.
8. You may not make use of buff mules (HS mules, SE mules, HB mules, etc.).
